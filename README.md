# MusicPopulationPrediction
Music popularity prediction means using regression techniques to forecast the popularity of songs based on various music features and metadata. Expected results include accurate predictions of a songâ€™s future performance in terms of streams, downloads, and chart positions, which enable music producers, artists, and marketers to make informed decisions.

To get started with music popularity prediction, we need a dataset of various songs with their musical features and historical data on how much popularity the songs got. I found an ideal dataset for this task which includes 227 music tracks, each described by their music features along with additional metadata like track name, artists, album name, and release date.
